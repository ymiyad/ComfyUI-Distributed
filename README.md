## Worker Types

<img width="200" align="right" alt="ComfyUI_temp_khvcc_00034_@0 25x" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/651e4912-7c23-4e32-bd88-250f5175e129" />

ComfyUI Distributed supports three types of workers:

- **Local Workers** - Additional GPUs on the same machine (auto-configured on first launch)
- **Remote Workers** - GPUs on other computers in your network
- **Cloud Workers** - GPUs hosted on a cloud service like Runpod, accessible via secure tunnels

> For detailed setup instructions, see the [setup guide](/docs/worker-setup-guides.md)

---

## Requirements

- ComfyUI
- Multiple NVIDIA GPUs
> No additional GPUs? Use [Cloud Workers](https://github.com/robertvoy/ComfyUI-Distributed/blob/main/docs/worker-setup-guides.md#cloud-workers)
- That's it

---

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository** into your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/robertvoy/ComfyUI-Distributed.git
   ```
   
2. **Restart ComfyUI**
   - If you'll be using remote/cloud workers, add `--enable-cors-header` to your launch arguments on the master

3. Read the [setup guide](/docs/worker-setup-guides.md) for adding workers

## Developer API

Control your distributed cluster programmatically without opening the browser.

* **Endpoint:** `POST /distributed/queue`
* **Functionality:** Accepts a ComfyUI API-format prompt, dispatches it to the requested reachable workers, and returns the master `prompt_id`.
* **Documentation:** [See API Examples & Scripts](https://github.com/robertvoy/ComfyUI-Distributed/blob/main/docs/comfyui-distributed-api.md)

> **⚠️ Security Warning:** Do not expose your ComfyUI port to the public internet. If you need remote access, run ComfyUI behind a secure proxy (like Cloudflare or a VPN).

---

## Distributed Value

Use **Distributed Value** when you want per-worker overrides (for example, different prompts/models/settings per worker).

- Output type adapts to the connected input where possible (`STRING`, `INT`, `FLOAT`, `COMBO`).
- The node shows only currently enabled workers.
- If worker enablement changes, worker fields update automatically.
- When disconnected, it resets to default string mode and clears per-worker overrides.
- On execution, master uses `default_value`; workers use their mapped override with typed coercion fallback to default.

## Compressed Result Transfer

**Distributed Collector** has two optional widgets that control how workers send their images back to the master. This matters most when workers run in the cloud and you pay for data leaving it (egress).

| `transfer_format` | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `legacy_png` (default) | lossless | Original behaviour: one JSON request per frame, uncompressed PNG in base64. Works with any master version. |
| `png` | lossless | Compressed PNG, binary, several frames per request. Same tensors as `legacy_png`. |
| `ffv1` | lossless | Whole batch as one FFV1 video. Same tensors as `legacy_png`; best lossless choice for frame sequences. |
| `jpeg`, `webp` | lossy | Per-frame stills. Good for image batches. |
| `h264`, `h265`, `av1` | lossy | Whole batch as one video. By far the smallest for video frame batches. |

`transfer_quality` (1–100, default 90) applies to the lossy formats. JPEG/WebP use it directly; video codecs map it to CRF (90 → CRF 13 for h264/h265, CRF 16 for av1; 100 → CRF 0).

Measured on a 121-frame 1280×720 batch (one worker's result):

| Format | Sent | vs legacy | PSNR |
|---|---|---|---|
| `legacy_png` | 446 MB | 1× | lossless |
| `png` | 163 MB | 2.7× | lossless |
| `ffv1` | 128 MB | 3.5× | lossless |
| `jpeg` q90 | 27 MB | 17× | 42.7 dB |
| `webp` q90 | 13 MB | 33× | 40.6 dB |
| `h264` q90 | 2.4 MB | 186× | 40.2 dB |
| `h265` q90 | 1.0 MB | 434× | 40.1 dB |
| `av1` q90 | 0.4 MB | 1031× | 40.5 dB |

The test clip is a slow pan, which video codecs compress especially well; expect smaller (still large) gains on content with more motion.

Notes:
- Choose the format on the master; the value is sent to workers with the workflow.
- The master must run this version to accept compressed results. A worker sending to an older master gets a 400 on its first request and automatically resends with `legacy_png`.
- If a worker's PyAV build lacks the requested video encoder, it falls back to `h264` (lossy formats) or `png` (`ffv1`), and logs it.
- Lossy formats only affect frames produced by workers; the master's own frames are never re-encoded.
- Requests are capped at about 32 MB each (`COMFYUI_DISTRIBUTED_TRANSFER_CHUNK_BYTES`), comfortably below ComfyUI's default 100 MB upload limit.
- Each worker logs what it sent, e.g. `Sent 121 image(s) as h264 in 1 request(s): 2.40 MB (raw 334.49 MB, 139.4x smaller)`.

## Nodes

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Distributed Seed** | Generates unique seeds for each worker |
| **Distributed Collector** | Collects results (image/video frames and optionally audio) from workers back to the master; `load_balance` can route the run to one least-busy participant |
| **Distributed Value** | Outputs per-worker override values with fallback to default |
| **Ultimate SD Upscale Distributed** | Distributes upscale tiles across workers |
| **Image Batch Divider** | Splits image batches for multi-GPU output |
| **Audio Segment Divider** | Splits an audio waveform into up to ten sequential time segments |
| **Distributed Model Name** | Passes model paths to workers, enabling workflows to use models not present on the master in orchestrator-only mode |
| **Distributed Empty Image** | Produces an empty IMAGE batch used when the master delegates all work |

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Does it combine VRAM of multiple GPUs?</summary>
No, it does not combine VRAM of multiple GPUs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it speed up the generation of a single image or video?</summary>
No, it does not speed up the generation of a single image or video. Instead, it enables the generation of more images or videos simultaneously. However, it can speed up the upscaling of a single image when using the Ultimate SD Upscale Distributed feature.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it work with the ComfyUI desktop app?</summary>
Yes, it does now.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I combine my RTX 5090 with a GTX 980 to get faster results?</summary>
Yes, you can combine different GPUs, but performance is optimized when using similar GPUs. A significant performance imbalance between GPUs may cause bottlenecks.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Does this work with cloud providers?</summary>
Yes, it is compatible with cloud providers. Refer to the setup guides for detailed instructions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use my main machine just to coordinate workers without rendering?</summary>
Yes. Open the Distributed panel and uncheck the master toggle to run in orchestrator-only mode. The master will distribute work to workers but won't render locally. If all workers become unavailable, the master automatically re-enables to ensure your workflow still runs.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I make this work with my Docker setup?</summary>
Yes, it is compatible with Docker setups, but you will need to configure your Docker environment yourself. Unfortunately, assistance with Docker configuration is not provided.
